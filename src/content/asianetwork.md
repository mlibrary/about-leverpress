<br>*ASIANetwork Books* strives to publish high-quality, original monographs, edited collections, and translations that embody a rigorous liberal arts approach to Asian Studies. A collaboration with [ASIANetwork](https://asianetwork.org/), a consortium of Asian Studies faculty at 160 colleges, the series seeks to fill a space between works that address the critical pedagogical strategies of the Asian Studies classroom and works of specialized scholarship that engage a broad readership outside higher education. Manuscripts published in the *ASIANetwork Books* series, no matter how narrowly focused, are expected to raise broad questions of interest for the public and demonstrate classroom utility for Asian Studies.

#### **About the Series**

Manuscripts representing a broad range of academic disciplines in the humanities, arts, social sciences, and sciences are appropriate for the series. *ASIANetwork Books* authors might work on traditional areas of strength in Asian Studies, including study of China and Japan, but might also work on less represented areas of Asia including, Korea, South or Southeast Asia, or the Pacific Rim. *ASIANetwork Books* is particularly interested in publishing works that address longstanding strengths of ASIANetwork members and its initiatives, including the focus on the arts, the environment, and digital approaches to the study of Asia, as well as emerging areas of focus, such as Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI)/Asian-American Studies, Blackness in Asia, Science and Public Health, and Socially Engaged Art.

The editors invite submissions that address particular countries, ethnic groups, and cultures, along with those that engage broader regions or movements that cross geopolitical boundaries. Project foci may be contemporary or historical, grounded in an academic discipline, in an interdisciplinary framework, or comparative approach; methodologies might include or combine original fieldwork, archival research, literary studies and translation, and/or quantitative analysis. Scholarly projects seeking to capitalize on the distinctive possibilities afforded by Lever Press’s open-access, digital publication platform, [Fulcrum](https://www.charleston-hub.com/2022/05/fulcrum-presents-the-next-big-thing-in-scholarly-communications-the-book/), are especially encouraged.

We strongly encourage authors to discuss a work’s pedagogical relevance when submitting their manuscript for consideration. While *ASIANetwork Books* assists teachers in their professional development as authors and deepens the understanding of Asia within campus communities, through its Open Access format it is also intended to provide a broader reading public with engaging and reliable scholarship about Asia.
