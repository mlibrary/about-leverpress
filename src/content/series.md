### [ASIANetwork Books](https://www.leverpress.org/asianetwork/)

*Series editors:* Erin McCarthy (St. Lawrence University) and Lisa Trivedi (Hamilton College)

<a class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/leverpress?f%5Bseries_sim%5D%5B%5D=ASIANetwork+Books&locale=en">Read <i>ASIANetwork Books</i></a>

This series publishes high-quality, original monographs embodying a rigorous liberal arts approach to Asian Studies. Manuscripts published in the *ASIANetwork* series, no matter how narrowly focused, are expected to raise broad questions of interest and potential classroom utility for Asian Studies scholars in the liberal arts. We encourage authors to discuss a work’s pedagogical relevance when submitting their manuscript for consideration. While the *ASIANetwork* Series assists teachers in their own professional development and deepens the understanding of Asia within our campus communities, it is also intended to provide a broader reading public with reliable and accurate scholarship about Asia.<br> <br>

### [](https://www.leverpress.org/filmminutes/)[C﻿inemas of Asia](https://www.leverpress.org/cinemasofasia/)

*Series editor:* Mridula Nath Chakraborty, Andrew David Jackson and Jason Jones (Monash University)

*Cinemas of Asia* is the first series devoted to the cinemas of South, Southeast, East, and Central Asia and global Asian diasporas. Each short-format volume of 30,000-40,000 words provides a critical analysis and interpretation of a single movie. The series aims to capture the diversity of Asian cinema for fans, lovers, and students of Asian film. Each volume is accessible, informative, written in an engaging style, and open to non-experts, academics, students, and cinephiles. All the books tell a story about why a particular film is worthy of consideration and how it is viewed within its context country.<br> <br>

### [film|minutes](https://www.leverpress.org/filmminutes/)

*Series editor:* Bernd Herzogenrath (Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Main)

*film|minutes* is a book series in the short monograph format, with each volume of c. 25,000–40,000 words focused on one particular film. Volumes in the series cut up films into segments of exactly one minute and transform each minute into a fruitful, innovative tool for thinking with the film. Each volume works rigorously with the concept of “the minute” as a non-cinematic scale/quantity and a means to look awry, to zoom in on (dis)orderly fragments that do not necessarily respect the confinements of (good) cinematic form or meaning. As a critical practice, the focus on minutes causes disruptions and displacement that create novel connections and perspectives that help us uncover hidden traces and make it possible to see each film anew.<br> <br>

### Open Access Musicology

*Series editors:* Daniel Barolsky (Beloit College) and Louis Epstein (St. Olaf College)

<a class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/leverpress?f%5Bseries_sim%5D%5B%5D=Open+Access+Musicology&locale=en">Read <i>Open Access Musicology</i></a>

*Open Access Musicology* is a free collection of essays, written in an accessible style and with a focus on modes of inquiry rather than content coverage. Our authors draw from their experience as scholars but also as teachers. They have been asked to describe why they became musicologists in the first place and how their individual paths led to the topics they explore and the questions they pose. Like most scholarly literature, the essays have all been reviewed by experts in the field. Unlike all scholarly literature, the essays have also been reviewed by students at a variety of institutions for clarity and relevance.<br> <br>

### [Re-Editions: Literary and Cultural Texts Recovered for the Classroom](https://www.leverpress.org/reeditions/)

*Series editor:* Michelle Burnham and Kirstyn Leuner (Santa Clara University)

<a class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/leverpress?f%5Bseries_sim%5D%5B%5D=Re-Editions%3A+Literary+and+Cultural+Texts+Recovered+for+the+Classroom&locale=en">Read <i>Re-Editions</i></a>

The *Re-Editions* series publishes lost, forgotten, or neglected literary and cultural texts, recovering marginalized voices and perspectives in new scholarly editions designed for use in undergraduate classrooms and beyond. Editions in the series will make previously overlooked or long out-of-print works–recovered from physical or digital archives, special collections, and the dustbins of history–newly available in digital editions for students, scholars, and the public. The series aims to recover important and field-reshaping texts from a range of historical periods, geographical regions, and genres, with the goal of making canons and curricula across disciplines more diverse, global, and inclusive.<br> <br>

### [R﻿efractions](https://www.leverpress.org/historiesofstem/)

*Series editor:* Darin Hayton (Haverford College) and Babak Ashrafi (Consortium for History of Science, Technology and Medicine)

*Refractions* focuses on historical and contemporary issues in the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, broadly understood. Volumes in the series are edited collections, each of which should offer perspectives from a variety of humanities and social sciences, which may include, history, sociology, anthropology, literature, gender studies. Content will emerge from a robust process of discussion and collaboration among the contributors, and may take the form of text, audio or video essays, debates, roundtables or other media and formats. Any novel contributions to scholarship should be written in a way that will be accessible to non-specialist audiences. We especially welcome analyses and expositions of scholarship that should be part of the broader public conversations.<br> <br>

### [Videographic Books: Film and Media Scholarship in Sound and Image](https://www.leverpress.org/videographicbooks/)

*Series editor:* Jason Mittell (Middlebury College)

<a class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/leverpress?f%5Bseries_sim%5D%5B%5D=Videographic+Books&locale=en">Read <i>Videographic Books</i></a>

Combining the possibilities of digital scholarship with the long-standing strengths of the print monograph, this series strives to publish works that convey ideas and expand knowledge via the digital rhetoric of videographic criticism. *Videographic Books* will resemble traditional print books as accessed via an online e-reader, but use embedded video and audio to convey ideas through the distinct form of [videographic criticism](https://sites.middlebury.edu/videoworkshop/what-is-videographic-criticism/). The published works will explore a wide-range of topics and approaches concerning film, television, videogames, and other media, but be united through a commitment to born-digital publishing as structured through the stable, archivable, and library-optimized open-access Fulcrum platform, and the use of audiovisual media as core components of intellectual expression, not just illustrations or examples.
