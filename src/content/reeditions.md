### Re-Editions: Literary and Cultural Texts Recovered for the Classroom

*Series editor:* Michelle Burnham and Kirstyn Leuner (Santa Clara University)

<a class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/leverpress?f%5Bseries_sim%5D%5B%5D=Re-Editions%3A+Literary+and+Cultural+Texts+Recovered+for+the+Classroom&locale=en">Read <i>Re-Editions</i></a>

<br>The *Re-Editions* series publishes lost, forgotten, or neglected literary and cultural texts, recovering marginalized voices and perspectives in new scholarly editions designed for use in undergraduate classrooms and beyond. Editions in the series will make previously overlooked or long out-of-print works–recovered from physical or digital archives, special collections, and the dustbins of history–newly available in digital editions for students, scholars, and the public. The series aims to recover important and field-reshaping texts from a range of historical periods, geographical regions, and genres, with the goal of making canons and curricula across disciplines more diverse, global, and inclusive.

#### **About the Series**

The scholarly practice of literary recovery can make both quick and lasting impacts on the way that literature, culture, and history is taught in classrooms and understood by students and the public. Many texts commonly taught today (Aphra Behn, Olaudah Equiano, Susanna Rowson, Harriet Jacobs, Rebecca Harding Davis, Zora Neale Hurston, and more) were once out of print, all but forgotten before scholars reprinted and brought new attention to them. The recovery of such texts have made lasting changes to the teaching and understanding of British, American, and global literatures, cultures, and histories. The *Re-Editions* series at Lever Press is dedicated to fostering such recovery efforts across disciplines and to bringing such editions into digital existence.

*Re-Editions* is dedicated to the project of literary recovery by identifying and reprinting texts that have been overlooked by dominant literary and cultural histories. The series aims to make such texts newly available to teachers, scholars, students, and the public in quality critical editions that take advantage of the affordances of digital publication and include a textual apparatus designed for the undergraduate teaching environment. In addition to an accessible introduction and informative appendixes that provide layered contexts for reading and studying the central work, editions might include photos, videos, maps, interactive timelines, hyperlinks, and data visualizations. The series aims to support and amplify the impact of research in archives and special collections for scholars, students, and the public.

The texts selected for editions in this series are typically not already available in a format usable for adoption in an undergraduate course. These texts might exist currently only in archives or special collections, in digitized scholarly or popular databases, or in out-of-print editions. In some cases, a more commonly available text might be considered for this series if the edition’s digital affordances allow for a very new presentation of the text. 

These born-digital editions are developed to take advantage of durable features of electronic publication that are highly usable in a classroom context. These editions include a textual apparatus designed specifically for undergraduate teaching across the liberal arts. That apparatus would provide context for the work, as well as editorial materials that help instructors and students discuss and write about the work. While the specific features of each edition within the series might differ depending on the editor’s vision and the text’s specificities, all meet 21st-century scholarly standards for textual editing (including transparency about copy text selection and accuracy of transcription).

Proposals for projects should follow [Lever Press’s guidelines](https://www.leverpress.org/authors) and should clarify how a proposed title will contribute to or change current assumptions about literary and cultural history.
