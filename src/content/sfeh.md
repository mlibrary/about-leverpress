### EcoSpeculations: Science Fiction and the Environmental Humanities

*Series editors:* Sarah Lohmann (ETH Zurich) and Chris Pak (Swansea University)

<br>*EcoSpeculations: Science Fiction and the Environmental Humanities* publishes critical new scholarship on science fiction within the context of the Environmental Humanities. Volumes in the series address the conceptual, historic, political, and formal dimensions of the mode/genre's engagement with environmental and climate change, gender, human-animal relationships, plant studies, science and technology, and more.

#### **About the Series**

Science fiction confronts the challenges posed by climate change, extractivism and the social, cultural, and political repercussions of technological change on localities, regions and planets. It offers reflections on the relationship between communities that include the non-human or more-than-human, exploring issues of agency, being, otherness and identity in ways that position the mode as a crucial source of analysis and critique for the Environmental Humanities. This contemporary engagement is informed by science fiction’s longstanding fascination with the human relationship to the non-human or more-than-human, with biology, evolution, ecology, and environmental transformation and deterioration. This long history of science fiction’s engagement with concerns that are central to the Environmental Humanities has been challenged and broadened through recognition of the contribution to the mode offered by global science fictions. This has prompted a scholarly and popular re-orientation of science fiction to include other subjectivities and agencies, as well as different modes of conceptualising science, community, space and place. 

*EcoSpeculations: Science Fiction and the Environmental Humanities* publishes both monographs and edited collections on science fiction that, within the context of the Environmental Humanities, address the conceptual, historic, political, and formal dimensions of science fiction’s engagement with environmental and climate change, gender, human-animal relationships, plant studies, science and technology, and more. For the purposes of this series, science fiction is understood to be a mode that encompasses a range of fictional and non-fictional forms, including but not limited to literature, performance, digital texts, film and TV, documentaries, games, art, advertising, music, activism, policy and pedagogy. 

*EcoSpeculations* opens a space for critical and creative inquiry into the multiple dimensions that inform our understanding of environmental issues through science fiction. The series frames science fiction as a fluid and developing concept that includes works that blur the boundaries between genres, and which includes future-oriented or speculative engagements from around the globe.
