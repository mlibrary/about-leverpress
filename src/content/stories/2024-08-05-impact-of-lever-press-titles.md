#### Lever’s Values and Commitments

When Lever Press was formed, its founders articulated a set of guiding values upon which the press would base its work—values that centered on publishing high quality scholarship aligned with the liberal arts ethos, using an economically sustainable approach, and establishing best practices for born-digital, peer reviewed, open access monograph publishing.

By embodying these values, the press would be “responsive to the needs of readers, authors, and member institutions, share our liberal arts focus broadly, and engage globally with others in the exchange of new scholarship”. [[Lever Press “Our Values”](https://www.leverpress.org/about/#values)]

Nine years in, and about to begin its third membership phase, Lever Press continues to publish open access, born-digital peer reviewed scholarship that benefits authors and scholars, teachers and students, and libraries and their institutions.

#### Quantitative Data

Lever’s titles are hosted on the Fulcrum platform and distributed to a number of book indexers, discovery services, and aggregator platforms including JSTOR Open Access eBooks, MUSE Open, and OAPEN and its Directory of Open Access Books. Publishers can run reports from each vendor to gather data about usage of their titles—how many times a title was viewed, downloaded, and for some vendors, from what country or territory. Gathering data from many separate sources can be a tedious undertaking, but was recently made easier by the introduction of the [Book Analytics Dashboard](https://www.leverpress.org/impact). This dashboard gathers in one place usage data from multiple sources, including downloads from OAPEN and Fulcrum as well as Crossref Event data (which captures online mentions or discussion of a title such as on social media, Wikipedia, blogs, news articles and the like). JSTOR data is not yet included but will be added soon.

From March of 2020 through May of 2024, the Book Analytics Dashboard shows that Lever titles have been accessed more than 55,000 times, downloaded over 48,000 times, had nearly 7,000 online mentions, and reached 172 countries and territories. When we add in the data from Lever title usage in JSTOR Open Access eBooks and MUSE Open, the numbers are even more impressive—Lever’s titles have been accessed globally more than 170,000 times, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and many locations in between.

 

#### Qualitative Data

However, quantitative data is only part of the picture; qualitative data from users is also needed to bring the usage and impact picture into better focus. To help capture this feedback, the Fulcrum platform, which hosts Lever’s titles along with those of many other publishers, allows users to voluntarily provide feedback through use of an unobtrusive Fulcrum Free Ebook Survey pop-up window. Those who don’t wish to respond can simply close the survey window and proceed with their session.

The survey allows users to voluntarily respond to any or all of these questions:

* How did you find out about this book?
* Why are you interested in this book?
* What are you going to do with it now that you have it?
* Is there anything else you would like to tell us or think we should know about how you found or are using the ebook, or about yourself?

There is also an option for respondents to indicate their willingness to be contacted to answer some follow-up questions via email.



#### What Users Are Saying

A look at the survey feedback illustrates how Lever is being responsive to the needs of scholars, teachers and students, libraries and their institutions, and readers writ large. Below are just some of the comments:

“Please keep producing robust OA works!

THANK YOU for leading the efforts to make an accessible reading experience more possible.” (*[What Kind of Island in What Kind of Sea](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12467134)*)
