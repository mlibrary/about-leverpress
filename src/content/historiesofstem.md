### Refractions

*Series editors:* Darin Hayton (Haverford College) and Babak Ashrafi (Consortium for History of Science, Technology and Medicine)

#### **About the Series**

Developments in science, technology and medicine have never had greater impact, or been more contested. Scholars draw on intellectual, social, and cultural history, as well as other fields in the humanities and social sciences, to describe and analyze these developments. In doing so, they offer historical perspectives on pressing contemporary issues, and provide a platform for broader public engagement with science, technology and medicine. The goal of *Refractions* is to bring those important scholarly currents and debates to a wider audience, including scholars from other fields, college-educated adults, advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students. 

*Refractions* focuses on historical and contemporary issues in the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, broadly understood. Volumes in the series are edited collections, each of which should offer perspectives from a variety of humanities and social sciences, which may include, history, sociology, anthropology, literature, gender studies. Content will emerge from a robust process of discussion and collaboration among the contributors, and may take the form of text, audio or video essays, debates, roundtables or other media and formats. Any novel contributions to scholarship should be written in a way that will be accessible to non-specialist audiences. We especially welcome analyses and expositions of scholarship that should be part of the broader public conversations.
