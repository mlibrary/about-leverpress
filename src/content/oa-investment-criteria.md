title: OA Investment Criteria and Lever Press
---
<span class="lead">June 2025</span>

## Overview

As the scholarly publishing landscape evolves, the number of open access publishing initiatives has grown significantly since [Lever Press](/) first launched in 2016. Faced with an increasing number of competing OA projects yet often shrinking budgets, many libraries are developing OA investment criteria<sup><a href="#note-1">*</a></sup> or guidelines to help them make the most informed decisions when considering which OA initiatives to support.

While the specifics of these guidelines or rubrics vary according to each library’s own unique communities and goals, there are some broad categories of importance to most all academic libraries based on shared values and commitments. To assist libraries with their evaluations, we’ve listed some of these categories below along with Lever’s responses. Click the section to expand and see details.

<small><em><sup><span id="note-1">*</span></sup> For example, the OA Investments Evaluation Rubric created by the University of Florida Libraries Open Access Committee, shared under a CC-BY-SA license ([https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RYHFU](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RYHFU)); see [Lever’s responses](/assets/oa-investment-criteria-and-lever-press.pdf).</em></small>

        <p>Lever Press is a born-digital, fully open access scholarly press whose operating costs are funded by the academic library members who support and govern it. As a diamond OA publisher, there is never a charge to authors or their institutions to publish with Lever, and its books are free to read and download by anyone anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
        <p>Among OA initiatives, Lever Press is unique in that it is governed by an oversight committee composed of representatives nominated from and elected by its member libraries; as such, academic libraries don’t just support Lever Press, they are the press. When libraries invest in Lever Press, they invest in themselves and those they serve. To put it another way, consider “value for values”--Lever Press embodies the values and commitments shared by the member libraries who provide Lever’s financial and leadership support.</p>
        <p>As noted in <a href="/assets/making-the-case-for-lever-press.pdf">Making the Case for Lever Press</a>, “We [academic libraries] have an obligation to craft models of scholarly publishing that align with our values, models that both benefit those who need access to information and those who produce the research. Lever Press does both.”</p>
        <p>Lever’s stated values are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="mb-1">leadership and the courage to push existing boundaries</li>
            <li class="mb-1">diverse voices and viewpoints</li>
            <li class="mb-1">the principles of equity and social justice</li>
            <li class="mb-1">building community among our members and beyond</li>
            <li class="mb-1">continuous learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(Lever Press <a href="/about/#values">Our Values</a>)
        <p>Lever seeks out, identifies, evaluates, and advocates for transformative scholarship that</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="mb-1">Emerges from creative dialogue within and between traditional fields of inquiry, with an emphasis on disciplinary innovation and transformation;</li>
            <li class="mb-1">Engages with issues of social and civic importance; and</li>
            <li class="mb-1">Transcends divisions between research and teaching by drawing from new models of collaborative inquiry addressing a broad audience.</li>

            <li class="mb-1">The Lever Press funding model described on the <a href="/join">Join Us</a> web page is intended to share the costs of running the press equitably among its members, and anticipates that a net membership gain over the previous phase in excess of the estimated required budget will result in reduced costs for all members (i.e., the more members who join, the less it will cost for everyone)</li>
            <li class="mb-1">The membership model uses a tiered pledge fee structure based on an institution’s most current materials expenditures; annual pledge fees range from $500 to $12,000 and have not increased since 2022</li>
            <li class="mb-1">The current Lever Press agreement is for a term of three years, and a copy of the pledge agreement is linked to on the <a href="/join">Join Us</a> page</li>
            <li class="mb-1">Lever’s current budget is $359,150 and is based on a goal of publishing 10 - 12 titles per year</li>
            <li class="mb-1">The average production direct cost per book is roughly $5,600 ($8,000 if production staff salaries are factored in)</li>
            <li class="mb-1">Lever’s revenue comes from pledge fees (currently pledged at $309,000/year); its expenses fall under the categories of Acquisitions and Editorial (currently budgeted at $20,000), Book Production (currently budgeted at $56,650), and Overhead (currently budgeted at $282,500) which includes salaries and benefits for staff members</li>

                <li class="mb-1">By publishing with a born-digital press, authors can take advantage of the digital affordances offered by its host platform Fulcrum–audio, video, and image files–as well as the ability to include additional material that doesn’t appear in the book itself such as course syllabi and assignment worksheets, thus freeing authors from the constraints imposed by traditional print-centric publishing</li>
                <li class="mb-1">Lever Press demonstrates its commitment to pedagogy by publishing books with classroom and education value:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="mb-1">titles about the undergraduate classroom, e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12217076"><i>Culture and Content in French: Frameworks for Innovative Curricula</i></a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12752519"><i>Transforming the Authority of the Archive: Undergraduate Pedagogy and Critical Digital Archives</i></a></li>
                        <li class="mb-1">titles about the academy and how to change it, e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12216775"><i>Academic Pipeline Programs: Diversifying Pathways from the Bachelor's to the Professoriate</i></a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11923682"><i>Faculty as Global Learners: Off-Campus Study at Liberal Arts Colleges</i></a></li>
                        <li class="mb-1">titles that can be used in college courses, e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12629286">La Princesse de Clèves <i>by Lafayette: A New Translation and Bilingual Pedagogical Edition for the Digital Age</i></a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12847233"><i>The Politics of India under Modi: An Introduction to India’s Democracy, Economy, and Foreign Policy</i></a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12159971">Sophokles’s <i>Women of Trachis</i></a></li>

            <p>Some thoughts from authors on why they chose to publish with Lever Press:</p>
            <blockquote>We wanted to work with a publisher “who is aligned with our values of giving voice to people. We have noted that Lever Press seeks proposals that bring diverse perspectives to current social, moral, and political issues.” [Phillip Joy, Mount Saint Vincent University, co-editors, <a href=" https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12912046"><i>Queer Compassion in 15 Comics</i></a>]</blockquote>
            <blockquote>“As professors who teach in liberal arts programs, we are also attracted to Lever Press’s commitment to interdisciplinary, accessible, public humanities scholarship that embraces undergraduates as a primary segment of its audience.” [Suzanne Churchill, Davidson College, Linda A. Kinnahan, Duquesne University, and Susan Rosenbaum, University of Georgia, co-authors, <i>Travels with Mina Loy: Navigating the Avant-Garde</i> (forthcoming)]</blockquote>
            <blockquote>“We are passionate about Lever Press’s open-access platform and the suitability of publishing research with its roots in the digital humanities in a born-digital format.” [Mackenzie Cooley, Hamilton College, and Wu Huiyi, CNRS (France), editors, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.14587972"><i>Knowing an Empire: Early Modern Chinese and Spanish Worlds in Dialogue</i></a>]</blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I was struck by the novelty of the approach to digital publishing and by the broad coalition of institutions behind [Lever Press]. Its funding and publishing model has really convinced me. The association with liberal arts colleges and the focus of the program make the press a very good fit with my manuscript. Both are cross-disciplinary in nature, interested in broad societal issues and socially engaged, while remaining committed to high standards of scholarly work.” [Gregor Dobler, Freiburg University, author, <i>Being at Liberty: The Productive Force of Unproductive Moments</i> (forthcoming)]</blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Lever’s mission matters to me on a personal level: I’m an Indigenous studies scholar, and much of my work concerns Indigenous communities. I was able to easily share my research with participating tribal community members—there was nothing in the way of red tape that often makes research reciprocity difficult. Overall, this aligns with my understanding of the liberal arts mission: interdisciplinary materials shared with a wide audience in the pursuit of better global education and understanding.” [Zoe Antoinette Eddy, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, editor of forthcoming title]</blockquote>
            <blockquote>“[M]y hope is to reach a broader group of readers than just those who have access to well-appointed research libraries or can pay the high costs of scholarship published by commercial publishers. As a teacher, I find the thought of accessible research being available for use in a class without having to consider the cost for students or the department quite appealing—the possibility to use a CC BY-NC license is a strong point in Lever Press’s favor from my perspective.” [Stefan Ekman, University of Gothenburg, author, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.14414299"><i>Urban Fantasy: Exploring Modernity through Magic</i></a>]</blockquote>
            <blockquote>“The Platinum open access model is a key reason for Lever Press to be my first choice of publisher for this project. Broadening access to knowledge, broadening definitions of knowledge, and diversifying audiences and styles of scholarly enquiry, are guiding principles in deciding what to write, and where and how to publish.” [Jo Lindsay Walton, University of Sussex, author of forthcoming title]</blockquote>

                                <blockquote>“Please keep producing robust OA works!
