Show your pride in Lever Press – it’s your press! – by sharing information about its books with your communities. Our mission is to produce the highest quality scholarship that embodies and reflects the values of the liberal arts. By sharing our books, we can help increase Lever’s visibility, encouraging authors to consider Lever as a potential publisher for their books and encouraging libraries to support Lever. 



For each new book published by the press, you will receive a virtual packet of information that you can use to share the news. 



You might consider:

* Re-tweeting the Lever Press new book announcement
* Sending an email about the book to faculty in relevant academic departments
* Adding a blurb to your library’s newsletter
* Adding a bib record for the book to your catalog; [MARC records are available through the FTP](https://ftp.fulcrum.org/Lever_Press/)
* Highlighting the book on your home page, and sharing through social media accounts
* Creating a physical or virtual exhibit featuring new Lever books (You can request a physical copy of a Lever book for your library by contacting [info@leverpress.org](mailto:info@leverpress.org)) 
* Hosting a book group discussion about a new Lever title
