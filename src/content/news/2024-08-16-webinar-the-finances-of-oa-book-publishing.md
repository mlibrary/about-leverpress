When you provide financial support for an open access publisher, your institution's money may be used in a wide variety of ways (to pay staff, to pay authors and peer-reviewers, to maintain digital platforms, etc.). Join Lever Press to take a deep dive into the transparent budget and funding model of an open access book publisher and improve your understanding so that you can make better OA investment decisions on behalf of your library.

By the end of the webinar:

* You will be able to describe how an open access press spends its money, and how that relates to its publishing mission and shared library missions and goals.
* You will be able to describe how the funding model and budget of an open access press supports its staff, authors, editorial board, and peer reviewers.
* You will be able to recognize how Lever Press may be distinctive or similar to other open access publishers.

**Curtis Brundy**, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communication and Collections, Iowa State University; Lever Press Oversight Committee Chair

**Anne Houston**, Director of Libraries and College Librarian, Swarthmore College; Lever Press Oversight Committee Treasurer
