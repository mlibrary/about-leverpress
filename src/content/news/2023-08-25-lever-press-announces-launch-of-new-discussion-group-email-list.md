The listserv will provide an opportunity for the Lever community to discuss topics of interest and share information. Discussion topics on this list might include: making Lever books visible in your discovery system; how to talk about Lever and open access publishing on your campus; how to talk about Lever with colleagues at other libraries; the latest Lever Press updates; and whatever else you are interested in discussing.

 

Interested staff from Lever Press member institutions can join by sending an email request with their name, title, and institution name to <info@leverpress.org>, subject line “Join Lever Discussion Group.”

 

Official Lever Press communications (calls for nominations; member meeting announcements; newsletters) will continue to be disseminated via the pledging institution distribution list, which is limited to institutional official Lever Press voting representatives.

 

If you have any questions about this new listserv, please e-mail [info@leverpress.org](mailto:info@leverpress.org). Terri Geitgey, program manager for Lever Press, serves as the list moderator.
