## Authors

We’re interested in proposals both for individual projects and for series of works consistent with our focus, scope, and goals as an open access publisher. 

We are particularly interested in work that fits our emerging lists in scholarship on the ancient world, media and popular culture, music and musicology, education, and histories of Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States. We are excited about and open to transdisciplinary projects that forge new connections and lay a groundwork for future scholarship.

As an open access publisher, we value what broader awareness of scholarship on questions of power and social location can contribute to both disciplinary conversations and public discourse, and we are thus actively interested in work on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and disability. To see some of our commitments in action, you can browse [our current series](https://www.leverpress.org/series/), which are accepting proposals.

To submit a proposal, please consider the guidelines below:

When you’re ready, [](mailto:info@leverpress.org)please submit a proposal directly to the acquiring editor, Sean Guynes, at sean@leverpress.org. We are also happy to field any questions and offer guidance prior to your submission. Reach out to the editor directly or, for more general inquiries, contact info@leverpress.org.

## The Lever Press Editorial Program

Lever Press is a publisher of pathbreaking scholarship. Supported by a consortium of liberal arts institutions focused on excellence in research and teaching, we have founded our press on three essential commitments:

* To be a press aligned with the ethos and mission of liberal arts colleges;
* To be a peer-reviewed, open access press that charges no fees to either authors or their institutions; and
* To publish media-rich, digitally native books simultaneously available in print. 

We seek out, identify, evaluate, and advocate for transformative scholarship that

* Emerges from **creative dialogue** within and between traditional fields of inquiry, with an emphasis on **disciplinary innovation and transformation**;
* Engages with issues of **social and civic importance**; and
* **Transcends divisions** between research and teaching by drawing from new models of **collaborative inquiry addressing a broad audience**.

This century has been marked by the tension between human progress and optimism on the one hand and increasingly complex global crises on the other hand. Creating the conditions for thriving communities, colleges, and universities in the coming decades requires moving beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries and finding ways to think and work together across divergent methodologies, perspectives, contexts—even, sometimes, fundamental commitments. Accordingly, Lever Press seeks proposals that bring diverse perspectives to bear upon pressing issues of social, moral, political, and scientific concern. 

Such projects might be single-authored monographs; they might also involve interdisciplinary groups of scholars bringing a variety of perspectives to bear on a given question; discussions among scholars of contending, even irreconcilable, viewpoints, modeling civil discourse; or a constructive approach to a question from a discipline not ordinarily thought to be the obvious starting point. 

Our works are published digitally on [Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrum.org/), which provides a platform allowing narrative to be richly integrated with associated data (images, videos, audio files, visualizations, etc.), optimized for long-term preservation and accessibility.
