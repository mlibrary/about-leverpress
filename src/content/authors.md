## The Lever Press Editorial Program

Lever Press is a publisher of pathbreaking scholarship. Supported by a consortium of liberal arts institutions focused on excellence in research and teaching, we have founded our press on three essential commitments:

* To be a press aligned with the ethos and mission of liberal arts colleges;
* To be a peer-reviewed, open access press that charges no fees to either authors or their institutions; and
* To publish rich media digital books simultaneously available in print. 

We seek out, identify, evaluate, and advocate for transformative scholarship that

* Emerges from **creative dialogue** within and between traditional fields of inquiry, with an emphasis on **disciplinary innovation and transformation**;
* Engages with issues of **social and civic importance**; and
* **Transcends divisions** between research and teaching by drawing from new models of **collaborative inquiry addressing a broad audience**.

This century has been marked by the tension between human progress and optimism on the one hand and increasingly complex global crises on the other hand. Creating the conditions for thriving communities, colleges, and universities in the coming decades requires moving beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries and finding ways to think and work together across divergent methodologies, perspectives, contexts—even, sometimes, fundamental commitments. Accordingly, Lever Press seeks proposals that bring diverse perspectives to bear upon pressing issues of social, moral, political, and scientific concern. 

 Such projects might be single-authored monographs; they might also involve interdisciplinary groups of scholars bringing a variety of perspectives to bear on a given question; discussions among scholars of contending, even irreconcilable, viewpoints, modeling civil discourse; or a constructive approach to a question from a discipline not ordinarily thought to be the obvious starting point. 

Our works are published on [Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrum.org/), which provides a platform allowing narrative to be richly integrated with associated data (images, videos, audio files, visualizations, etc.), optimized for long-term preservation and accessibility. 

## Existing series

 *ASIANetwork Books*, series editors Erin McCarthy and Lisa Trivedi 

This series publishes high-quality, original monographs embodying a rigorous liberal arts approach to Asian Studies. Manuscripts published in the ASIANetwork series, no matter how narrowly focused, are expected to raise broad questions of interest and potential classroom utility for Asian Studies scholars in the liberal arts. We encourage authors to discuss a work’s pedagogical relevance when submitting their manuscript for consideration. While the *ASIANetwork Series* assists teachers in their own professional development and deepens the understanding of Asia within our campus communities, it is also intended to provide a broader reading public with reliable and accurate scholarship about Asia. 

*Multimodal Monographs*, series editor Jason Mittell

Combining the possibilities of digital scholarship with the long-standing strengths of the print monograph, this series strives to publish works that *convey ideas and expand knowledge via digital rhetorics*. Multimodal Monographs will resemble traditional print books as accessed via an online e-reader, but use embedded media forms such as video, audio, and high-resolution images to convey ideas that could not be sufficiently expressed in static print. The published works will explore a wide-range of topics and approaches, but be united through a commitment to born-digital publishing as structured through the stable, archivable, and library-optimized open-access Fulcrum platform, and the use of media assets as core components of intellectual expression, not just illustrations or examples.

*Re-Editions*: Literary and cultural texts, recovered for the classroom, series editor Michelle Burnham 

The Re-Editions series is dedicated to recovering forgotten or overlooked texts from archives, special collections, and the dustbins of history. Quality critical digital editions of books with the potential to change the way we imagine and teach literary and cultural history, suitable for classroom use.   

## Areas of Interest

*Teaching, Learning, and Leading in Liberal Arts Colleges* 

Liberal arts colleges have played a distinctive, leadership role in the development of American higher education. Lever Press seeks to publish work that highlights excellence in the scholarship of teaching and learning and strategies that enable transformational student development. We will also seek contributions from academic leadership reflecting on the present and future state of liberal arts education, providing a forum for both constructive self-reflection and leadership for policy makers, administrators, trustees, graduates, and others who care about sustaining and improving upon the liberal arts college tradition.

*Archives and Special Collections*

The Helen Hartness Flanders Ballad Archive at Middlebury College and the Kuna Indian or Burmese works housed in the Denison Museum are just two of many examples of the remarkable materials held by many liberal arts colleges. Lever Press welcomes interdisciplinary studies of a specific collection, and encourages thematic studies across institutional collections that promote collaboration and illustrate our connections. Of particular interest are as-yet unexplored narratives of communities, movements, and populations whose voices have been marginalized and excluded.
