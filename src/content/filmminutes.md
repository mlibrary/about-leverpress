<br>*film|minutes* is a book series in the short monograph format, with each volume of c. 25,000–40,000 words focused on one particular film. Volumes in the series cut up films into segments of exactly one minute and transform each minute into a fruitful, innovative tool for thinking with the film. Each volume works rigorously with the concept of “the minute” as a non-cinematic scale/quantity and a means to look awry, to zoom in on (dis)orderly fragments that do not necessarily respect the confinements of (good) cinematic form or meaning. As a critical practice, the focus on minutes causes disruptions and displacement that create novel connections and perspectives that help us uncover hidden traces and make it possible to see each film anew.

#### **About the Series**

Academic books about films more often than not are subordinate analyses that (mis)use the film to illustrate a thesis or theory. *film|minutes*, however, pushes authors to think with film from a decidedly film-philosophical perspective as a kind of practical aesthetics. By focusing on the simultaneously arbitrary and meaningful unit of “the minute,” volumes in this series allow films to become critical interlocutors that emerge as something more than the sum of their parts. The series acknowledges the contingent fantasy that every single minute is simultaneously complete in its own terms, and part of a larger whole. The merciless grid of the minute causes disruptions and displacements that create new connections and novel perspectives, making it possible to see each film anew.

*film|minutes* facilitates a playful, even joyful, engagement with the breadth of cinematic experiences and the forms that structure it, laying bare minutiae—for example, of sound, light, expression, color, affective resonances, and more that might otherwise go unnoticed—made visible through this mode of “slow screening” while never losing sight of the film as a whole. Such a delightfully eclectic approach to the minute as a series of varied and form-giving punctums can reveal the multiplicity of layers that, together, we call film. In this way, the minute becomes a code for unlocking a series of revelations about film not as an object of, but as a medium for, idiosyncratic ways of thinking. Authors are also encouraged to think creatively and experimentally with(in) the minutes of their films.

Each book in *film|minutes* will focus on a single film and consist of as many short, critical vignettes of c. 300 words as the number of minutes of the film’s length. Films considered for inclusion in the series can come from any period in the history of global cinemas and may range across genres and production categories: from blockbuster Hollywood films to art-/grindhouse features, Bollywood musicals to South Korean dramas, 1970s exploitation to early silent film, indie auteur cinema to tentpole franchise entries—and everything in between. The average length of a manuscript about a typical c. ninety-minute film is expected to be c. 25,000 words, with the length of each volume tied to the length of the film under consideration.

This series was inspired by the critical approach taken by Michael Baute and Volker Pantenburg in *93 Minutentexte: The Night of the Hunter* (Brinkmann und Bose Verlag, 2006).

##### **The *film|minutes*** video|graphic Workstation

The [*film|minutes* video|graphic workstation](https://doi.org/10.25740/xq320wq3449), created by series author Shane Denson, is a combination video player and text editor designed for close analysis of moving image media in scholarly research and academic writing, including student writing about film and video. The app plays videos on loop, one minute at a time, while the user enters notes or commentary on that segment. Timestamped notes are saved as .txt files that can be reloaded and revised at a later time. Accordingly, the app serves either as a writing tool (as an informal notebook, for example, or for composing more complex and detailed close readings of films) or as a platform for reading previously compiled texts. The app was designed to facilitate the type of writing featured in Lever Press's *film|minutes* book series, from which the workstation takes its name. Each book in the series takes a minute-by-minute approach to an individual film and conducts a close analysis on this basis. The app's programmer, Shane Denson, is also the author of the first book in the series, on the 1935 film Bride of Frankenstein. A demo featuring the video and corresponding text of the first ten minutes of the book/film are included in the app. In addition to its use as a tool for writing, the app promotes reflection on the relation of text and image in an age of digital media, where conventional scholarly writing now competes with "videographic criticism" (or video essays). Instituting what might be called a videographic method, though not necessarily producing a strictly videographic product, the film|minutes video|graphic workstation invites users to reflect on the status of the seen (video) and the written (graphic) more generally.
