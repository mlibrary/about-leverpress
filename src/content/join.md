        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Who we are</h2>
        <p class="lead"><span class="intro scala-sans text-primary">Lever Press arose</span> from an initiative of the Oberlin Group of Libraries that explored how liberal arts colleges could offer new and compelling alternatives to existing models of scholarly publishing.</p>
        <p>We seek out, identify, evaluate, and advocate for transformative scholarship that spurs creative dialogue within and between traditional fields of inquiry, emphasizes disciplinary innovation, draws upon new models of collaborative research, and strives to reach the broadest audience possible.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Membership Model</h2>
        <p class="lead">Publishing high-quality scholarship is costly. No one disputes this.</p>
        <p>Lever Press is premised on the idea that it’s better to pay once for a work and create an open access result than to cover costs through a system demanding repeated payments—for purchasing, for copying, for long-term preservation, etc. This “pay-in-the-middle” membership model replaces paying at the consumer end or the producer end. Both of those models end up driving, not addressing, the growing inequality in access to scholarly information.</p>
        <p>Libraries that provide support for Lever Press become part of the conversation shaping both the editorial program and objectives of the press and the principles by which we do our work.</p>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="mb-0">The reality is that someone has to pay for the development and distribution of an OA publisher’s content, and that has typically fallen on individual scholars and their institutions. The new Lever Press OA endeavor, with its innovative cost-sharing model, may have a profound impact on shifting that reality.</p>

        <p class="mb-0">Lever Press’ editorial board’s stated goal is to publish work that carries with it a liberal arts ethos — not a pretentious snobbishness, but a commitment to producing scholarship with the potential to make a tangible impact, and to making sure that scholarship is shared with anybody who wants to read it.</p>
