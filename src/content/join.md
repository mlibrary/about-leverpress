        <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Membership Model</h2>
        <p>Lever’s funding model is designed to share the costs of running Lever Press equitably among our members. Our annual budget includes expenditures for acquisitions, book production, and overhead including staff salaries (including annual raises for staff), outreach, marketing and member management. We also receive in-kind support from Michigan Publishing, but member pledges reflect almost all of the actual total costs of running an open access press; Lever is not subsidized by Michigan or by an existing scholarly press.</p>
        <p>Members make 3-year pledges to support Lever, a membership term that we believe is short enough to not burden members with a lengthy financial commitment yet long enough to provide us with a stable, foreseeable budget to keep operations running smoothly and to anticipate the number of publishing contracts we can commit to for the next several years.</p>
        <p>Each member’s annual cost will not exceed the amount committed to in their 3-year pledge, but may be less. It is anticipated that a net membership gain during the pledge cycle will lead to reduced annual cost allocations for all members in years 2 and 3 depending on the total budget needed for those years.
        </p>
        <p>The budget is developed by the Oversight Committee each August for the following calendar year, and announced to the membership in September along with each member’s contribution for the coming year. After a brief period of time for member comment, the budget is approved by the Oversight Committee. The Oversight Committee is composed of member representatives, and all members have the opportunity to run for election to the Oversight Committee and are encouraged to provide input into the budgeting process.
