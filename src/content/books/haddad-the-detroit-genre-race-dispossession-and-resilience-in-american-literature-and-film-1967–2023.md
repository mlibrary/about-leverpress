title: "The Detroit Genre: Race, Dispossession, and Resilience in American
  Literature and Film, 1967–2023"
authorLastname: Haddad
author: Vincent Haddad

description: Detroit has an essential relationship to genre in American
  literature and popular culture. The contemporary formations of the suburban
  sitcom, the post-apocalyptic genre, the sci-fi dystopia, crime fiction, the
  superhero genre, and contemporary horror would not exist in the way they do
  today without the aesthetic material and racial history of Detroit. When DC
  Comics wanted to compete with Marvel and market “socially relevant” comics,
  especially ones dealing with issues of race, they swapped Gotham and
  Metropolis for Detroit. What about vampires concerned with
  de-industrialization, heritage conservation, and impending water wars? Must be
  Detroit. A story about a half-man, half-robot wrestling with what it means to
  be human by fighting crime? Improbably, Detroit has two. Author Vincent
  Haddad’s The Detroit Genre provides the first comprehensive literary and
  cultural investigation of the representations of Detroit in popular and
  literary culture.
