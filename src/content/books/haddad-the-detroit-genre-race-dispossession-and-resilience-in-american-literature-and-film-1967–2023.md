description: The Detroit Genre provides the first comprehensive literary and
  cultural investigation of the representations of Detroit in popular and
  literary culture and argues that the suburban sitcom, the post-apocalyptic
  genre, the sci-fi dystopia, crime fiction, the superhero genre, and
  contemporary horror would not exist in the way they do today without the
  aesthetic, material, and racial history of Detroit.
