  Literature and Film, 1967–2023"
authorLastname: Haddad

description: Detroit has an essential relationship to genre in American
  literature and popular culture. The contemporary formations of the suburban
  sitcom, the post-apocalyptic genre, the sci-fi dystopia, crime fiction, the
  superhero genre, and contemporary horror would not exist in the way they do
  today without the aesthetic material and racial history of Detroit. Author
  Vincent Haddad’s The Detroit Genre provides the first comprehensive literary
  and cultural investigation of the representations of Detroit in popular and
  literary culture.
