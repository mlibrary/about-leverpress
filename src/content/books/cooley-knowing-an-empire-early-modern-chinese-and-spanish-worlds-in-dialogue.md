description: "Knowing an Empire: Early Modern Chinese and Spanish Worlds in
  Dialogue unveils how these two vast empires, separated by thousands of miles,
  developed comparable systems to gather, order, and wield knowledge about their
  local worlds. Through a new methodology of “juxtapositional comparison,” the
  book reads the difangzhi 地方志 (local gazetteers) of China and the relaciones
  geográficas of the Spanish world in parallel."
