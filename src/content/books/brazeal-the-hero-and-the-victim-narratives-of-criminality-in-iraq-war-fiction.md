description: "Two decades after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, a canon of
  American literature about the war has begun to emerge. Gregory Brazeal’s The
  Hero and the Victim situates Iraq War fiction in war literature’s broader
  history. Iraq War fiction reflects the troubled emergence of a new narrative
  in the long history of war fiction: the story of the ordinary soldier as a
  wrongdoer or even criminal."
