description: "Two decades after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, a canon of
  American literature about the war has begun to emerge. Gregory Brazeal’s The
  Hero and the Victim situates Iraq War fiction in war literature’s broader
  history. In contrast to the emphasis of most pre-modern war literature on the
  figure of the warrior-as-hero, and the growing modern emphasis on the figure
  of the soldier-as-victim, Iraq War fiction reflects the troubled emergence of
  a new narrative: the story of the ordinary soldier as a wrongdoer or even
  criminal."
