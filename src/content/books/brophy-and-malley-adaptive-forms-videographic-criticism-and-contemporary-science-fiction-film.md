description: Adaptive Forms employs videographic essays to explore the themes,
  ideas, and visual language through which media culture constantly evolves and
  adapts. Focusing on contemporary science fiction film, this analysis considers
  affinities between the genre’s expansive concerns with technological and
  social adaption, and cinema’s own evolutionary responses to technological and
  aesthetic change.
