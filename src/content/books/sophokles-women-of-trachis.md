description: >-
  This new Sophokles translation is a living script in conversation with the
  past. Rachel Kitzinger, a Classicist, and Eamon Grennan, a poet, have captured
  the tones of ancient Greek in strong, swift English. The unique addition of an
  audio recording of the text performed by Vassar College students contributes
  to the play's accessibility and vividness.
