description: "Todayâ€™s aesthetic strategies to compose content and identity
  across digital media are neither new nor exclusively digital, but emerged from
  migration. In Drift Net: The Aesthetics of Literature and Media in Migration,
  Chris Campanioni theorizes an aesthetics of transmedia as a framework for
  civic activism, while showing how migrants have forecasted and reshaped new
  media practices and norms, producing a political subjectivity that resists
  subjectification. As borders, global inequality, racism, and xenophobia
  proliferate, migrants continue to enact the possibilities of something else,
  beyond being spoken about and spoken for."
